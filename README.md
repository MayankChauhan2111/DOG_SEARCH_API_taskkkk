Problem 2: Dog Search Using the APIs (might require you to create a free account) https://docs.thedogapi.com/, do the following: 1. Create a page which shows a search box. 2. When a user attempts to enter into a search box any string longer than 3 characters, show possible matches (Images only) at the bottom of the search bar. 3. The user should not need to press enter. As soon as the fourth character is typed, add all matching dogs below. 4. When the Fifth character is typed, remove (don’t refresh the page) the images which didn’t match those dogs. 5. When the sixth character is typed, remove the images which didn’t match the dogs already shown in step (4). And so on. 6. To start with, in case images are taking time, you can show a list of all matching breed names and then remove names from that. To prevent rate limiter, you can show a maximum of 6 photos on each call.
